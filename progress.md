# Progress Log: Creative IDE Engine Maturity

## Session: 2026-06-24

### Phase 1: UX Inventory And Workspace Sizing
- **Status:** in_progress
- Actions taken:
  - Confirmed current worktree `/Users/sunmeng/workspace/fc-creative-mode` is on branch `codex/creative-mode-simple-game` and initially clean.
  - Read existing planning files and found they described an older NES hardware accuracy objective.
  - Replaced planning memory with the current Creative IDE maturity objective.
  - Started code inventory for `IdeView.vue`, `MapEditorPanel.vue`, `ChrEditorPanel.vue`, and `TrackerPanel.vue`.
  - Confirmed the live emulator MCP is already embedded in the Tauri process and uses the visible `EmuState`.
  - Added frontend live MCP status state to the emulator Pinia store.
  - Added `emu_mcp_status` as an explicit Tauri command so the frontend can recover MCP online state after window mount or Vite reload.
  - Added player toolbar status for live MCP connection/errors/recent tool activity.
  - Expanded the map editor work area by making the map canvas wrapper fill the panel body and turning the tile resource area into a toggleable overlay drawer.
  - Added a map context bar that keeps map path, bound CHR, selection, and hover coordinate visible without consuming side-panel width.
- Initial observations:
  - The three target editors already contain some ResizeObserver-based adaptive logic in script, so the likely bottleneck is template/CSS panel layout and workflow integration.
  - Map/CHR binding is represented by `chrChoices` and `boundChrForActiveMap`, but the continuity of the interaction still needs inspection.

## Test Results
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| `cd fc-tauri && npx vue-tsc --noEmit` | PASS |
| `cargo check --manifest-path fc-tauri/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | PASS |
| `npm --prefix fc-tauri run build` | PASS, with existing Vite large chunk warning |
| `git diff --check` | PASS |
| `npm --prefix fc-tauri run tauri dev` | PASS; Tauri app started and all three MCP sockets appeared |
| `target/debug/fc emu-mcp` initialize/tools-list | PASS; server identified as `fc-tauri-emu-mcp` |
| live `emu_load_rom` with `/Users/sunmeng/workspace/fc/roms/SuperMarioBro.nes` | PASS; visible Vue store switched to player/main with `SuperMarioBro.nes` |
| live `emu_set_speed`, `emu_control`, `emu_step_frame`, `emu_get_state` | PASS; store and runtime state reflected MCP operations |
| Tauri DOM/store inspection | PASS; `window.__emu.liveMcp.online=true`, toolbar MCP pill class `mcpstat on` |
| `tauri_screenshot` | FAILED in environment: window detection reported no visible window; direct store/DOM and MCP screenshot paths worked |

## Error Log
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-06-24 | Planning files were for old hardware accuracy goal | Session catchup/read found stale objective | Rewrote planning files for Creative IDE maturity |
| 2026-06-24 | Runtime ROM path missing | Tried live `emu_load_rom` from `/Users/sunmeng/workspace/fc-creative-mode/roms/SuperMarioBro.nes` | Retried with `/Users/sunmeng/workspace/fc/roms/SuperMarioBro.nes` and verified visible player update |
| 2026-06-24 | Native Tauri screenshot unavailable | Called `tauri_screenshot` after app launch | Used Tauri eval store/DOM inspection plus live MCP frame capture as verification |
